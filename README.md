# Project 1: COVID Case Study
## Background

In December 2019, COVID-19 (coronavirus disease 2019) was discovered in Wuhan, China. It is a disease caused by a virus named SARS-CoV-2 that was very contagious and quickly spread around the world. A disease that can feel much like a cold, flu, or pneumonia can attack more than your lungs and respiratory system, other parts of your body may also be affected. Hundreds of thousands of people died in the United States alone. 

On January 21, 2020, the CDC confirmed the first case in Washington state. The individual had traveled and returned from Wuhan on January 15th. On March 11, 2020, WHO declares COVID-19 a pandemic. About a week later, on March 19, 2020, a national emergency is declared in the United States. 

A vaccine was later released on December 10, 2020 when an FDA advisory panel recommends Pfizer BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine. On December 17th, an FDA panel backs Moderna COVID-19 vaccine. 

By December 30, 2020, 14 million doses had been distributed out of the allocated 20 million doses.

## Case Analysis Question
Reviewing Confirmed %,  Recovered %, and Death Rate % in the United States, was there a change in the highest affected states before and after the vaccine, and how did the vaccine affect the rates?

Was there an impact on those states that had the highest Vaccinated % in the United States?

## Presentation Requirements
You will prepare a formal 10-minute presentation that covers the following topics:

Questions that you found interesting and what motivated you to answer them
  <br />Where and how you found the data you used to answer these questions
  <br />The data exploration and cleanup process (accompanied by your Jupyter notebook)
 <br /> The analysis process (accompanied by your Jupyter notebook)
 <br /> Your conclusions, including a numerical summary and visualizations of the summary
 <br /> The implications of your findings: what do your findings mean?

## Development Requirements
Use Pandas to clean and format your dataset or datasets. 
<br />Create a Jupyter notebook describing the data exploration and cleanup process.
<br />Create a Jupyter notebook illustrating the final data analysis.
<br />Use Matplotlib to create 6 to 8 visualizations of your data 
<br />(ideally, at least 2 visualizations per “question” that you ask your data).
<br />Save PNG images of your visualizations to distribute to the class and instructional team—and for 
inclusion in your presentation.
<br />Create a write-up summarizing your major findings. This should include a heading for each “question” 
that you asked your data as well as a short description of your findings and any relevant plots.
<br />Bonus: Use at least one API—if you can find one with data pertinent to your primary research questions.

## Analysis
The vaccine did not affect the confirmed %s, but it did cause the death rate to decrease.
Three of the top 5 states that had the highest confirmed also had the highest recovery rate.
When comparing the top 5 states in Confirmed Rate %, Recovery Rate % and Death Rate %, we did not see consistency of the states before and after the vaccine.
We did not see a strong correlation between the states with the highest vaccination rates and the Recovery Rate %. 

## Successes and Challenges
A challenge was narrowing down our topics, but we were able to finally conceptualize what we were trying to analyze to determine a topic that best worked for us.
