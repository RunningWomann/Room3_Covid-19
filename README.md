# Project 1: COVID Case Study
## Background

In December 2019, COVID-19 (coronavirus disease 2019) was discovered in Wuhan, China. It is a disease caused by a virus named SARS-CoV-2 that was very contagious and quickly spread around the world. A disease that can feel much like a cold, flu, or pneumonia can attack more than your lungs and respiratory system, other parts of your body may also be affected. Hundreds of thousands of people died in the United States alone. 

## Project Overview

### Presentation Requirements
You will prepare a formal 10-minute presentation that covers the following topics:
  Questions that you found interesting and what motivated you to answer them
  Where and how you found the data you used to answer these questions
  The data exploration and cleanup process (accompanied by your Jupyter notebook)
  The analysis process (accompanied by your Jupyter notebook)
  Your conclusions, including a numerical summary and visualizations of the summary
  The implications of your findings: what do your findings mean?

### Development Requirements
Use Pandas to clean and format your dataset or datasets. 
Create a Jupyter notebook describing the data exploration and cleanup process.
Create a Jupyter notebook illustrating the final data analysis.
Use Matplotlib to create 6 to 8 visualizations of your data 
(ideally, at least 2 visualizations per “question” that you ask your data).
Save PNG images of your visualizations to distribute to the class and instructional team—and for 
inclusion in your presentation.
Create a write-up summarizing your major findings. This should include a heading for each “question” 
that you asked your data as well as a short description of your findings and any relevant plots.
Bonus: Use at least one API—if you can find one with data pertinent to your primary research questions.
